FRAMEWORK vs LIBRARY

A framework is a set of code libraries and data-structures, that provide generic functionality which can be used, overridden or further specialized.

Well the main difference, is that a framework is going to do more for you than a simple code library would. It's going to provide more structure, dictate the flow control of the program, and have a lot of default behaviors built in. Libraries typically don't do anything, until you ask them to. The Rails framework is actually going to do a lot, on its own, as a default behavior.


DRY code: "Don't repeat yourself"
* concise, consistent, easy to maintain

---------------------------------------

MVC - MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER
>> See Basic Web Architecture vs MVC model slides.
	* MODEL
	The data structure. Either objects or the database.
	* VIEW
	What the user see and interacts with. In this case, the html pages, including the css and javaScript.
	* CONTROLLER
	processes and responds to user events. Controls the interaction between model and view.

---------------------------------------

EDITING THE SHELL PREFERENCES

$nano .bash_profile

alias ll="ls -lahG"

export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"

---------------------------------------

INSTALL XCODE

Xcode contains a compiler called GCC

It used to be that Xcode automatically installed the developer tools.

Now you have to go to Xcode > Preferences > Downloads > Command Line Tool

Note: We'll need both gcc and make to compile software.

---------------------------------------

INSTALL RUBYGEMS

A gem is Ruby application packaged. RubyGems is the package manager for those applications.

gem update --system
gem --help

---------------------------------------

INSTALL RAILS

gem install bundler

gem install rails --no-ri --no-rdoc
(speeds up the installation, doesn't copy documentation files)

gem install rails --no-ri --no-rdoc --version 4.0.0
(if you want to specify a version)

---------------------------------------

MY SQL

Other databases SQLlite posGress

* Homebrew
	* brew install mysql
	* launch at start:
	ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

	*load now:
	launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist

	* just start:
	

* Set a default MySQL password
	* mysql.server start

* Install MySQL RubyGem

* mysql.server	start
		stop
		status

	mysql -u root
	exit

Create password: mysqladmin -u root password

	mysql -u root -p
	type password (I saved as the same as the computer!)

Install the MySQL gem: gem install mysql2

---------------------------------------

WEB SERVER

Mac OS 10 already ships with an Apache server! If you do system preferences > sharing > internet sharing you'll be activating it

Web Servers

	* Apache
		* Passenger/mod_rails: Apache module to talk to Rails (it's the most popular)

	* WEBrick: ships with Rails
	
---------------------------------------

TEXT EDITOR

Create alias for sublime though the command line
ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl

Now if you type "subl someFile" you can open it with Sublime
