CREATING THE DATABASE

SHOW DATABASES;
CREATE DATABASE db_name;
USE db_name;
DROP DATABASE db_name;

CREATE DATABASE triplec_development;

Create a user
	 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON triplec_development.*
	TO 'udit'@'localhost'
	IDENTIFIED BY 'anything';

	SHOW GRANTS FOR 'udit'@'localhost';

	udit: anything
	triplec: triplec

mysql -u triplec -p triplec_development

--------------------------------------------------------

CONFIGURE PROJECT

In the project folder:
	rake db:schema:dump

RAKE???
	Ruby helper program
	"ruby make"

	rake -T (show commands)
	rake -T db (show db commands)

To switch environments, do:

rake db:schema:dump RAILS_ENV=development
rake db:schema:dump RAILS_ENV=production
	(this one won't work because we don't have a production environment set up)

--------------------------------------------------------

MIGRATIONS

* Keeps database schema with application code
* Executable and repeatable
* Allows sharing schema changes (to the database)
* Helps with versioning
* Allows writing Ruby instead of SQL

Create a migration
	rails generate migration DoNothingYet
	(creates a migration with timestamp)

Create a model
	rails generate model User (model name is singular, migration is plural)

Files are gonna be stored in db/migrate

--------------------------------------------------------

RUNNING MIGRATIONS

rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development

go to mySql
	SHOW DATABASES;
	SHOW FIELDS FROM users;

SHOW FIELDS FROM schema_migrations;
	schema_migrations keeps track of the database versions

rake db:migrate VERSION=0
	Like "roll back to commit 0"

rake db:migrate:status
	Like "show history"

rake db:migrate VERSION=20150323225903
	Like "roll back to this commit"

--------------------------------------------------------

MIGRATION METHODS

rails generate migration AlterUsers

	Take a look into db/migrate/...alter_users.rb

	IMPORTANT: add_index to foreign keys (linked from another table) and things you'll look up for frequently (like user ids)

	* start the server:
		mysql.server start	
		mysql -u triplec -p triplec_development

	* run the migration: rake db:migrate

rails generate model Project

NOTES:
	* Any changes you make to a table, either on the createTable or alterTable migration, WON'T RUN AGAIN. You need to crate a new migration if you want to add a column to a table, for instance.
